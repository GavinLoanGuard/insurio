## 🚨 TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE

### "My phone number doesn't work"
→ Check you replaced ALL instances of (403) 555-1234  
→ Search files for "555-1234" to confirm

### "Forms aren't submitting"
→ Confirm you replaced PLACEHOLDER with real Formspree ID  
→ Check Formspree dashboard for submissions  
→ Check spam folder for test emails

### "Images are broken"
→ Confirm images folder uploaded correctly  
→ Check image filenames match HTML (case-sensitive)  
→ Check browser console for 404 errors

### "Site is slow on mobile"
→ Ensure you're testing on real 3G/4G, not WiFi  
→ Check images are webp format (not jpg/png)  
→ Run Google PageSpeed Insights test

### "Google isn't showing my site"
→ Takes 1-3 days for new sites to index  
→ Submit sitemap in Search Console  
→ Request indexing manually for homepage  
→ Create a few backlinks (LinkedIn, directory listings)
